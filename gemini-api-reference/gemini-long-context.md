Gemini 2.0 Flash and Gemini 1.5 Flash come with a 1-million-token context window, and Gemini 1.5 Pro comes with a 2-million-token context window. Historically, large language models (LLMs) were significantly limited by the amount of text (or tokens) that could be passed to the model at one time. The Gemini 1.5 long context window, with [near-perfect retrieval (>99%)](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/gemini/gemini_v1_5_report.pdf), unlocks many new use cases and developer paradigms.

The code you already use for cases like [text generation](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/text-generation) or [multimodal inputs](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/vision) will work out of the box with long context.

Throughout this guide, you briefly explore the basics of the context window, how developers should think about long context, various real world use cases for long context, and ways to optimize the usage of long context.

## What is a context window?

The basic way you use the Gemini models is by passing information (context) to the model, which will subsequently generate a response. An analogy for the context window is short term memory. There is a limited amount of information that can be stored in someone's short term memory, and the same is true for generative models.

You can read more about how models work under the hood in our [generative models guide](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/prompting-strategies#under-the-hood).

## Getting started with long context

Most generative models created in the last few years were only capable of processing 8,000 tokens at a time. Newer models pushed this further by accepting 32,000 tokens or 128,000 tokens. Gemini 1.5 is the first model capable of accepting 1 million tokens, and now [2 million tokens with Gemini 1.5 Pro](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/new-features-for-the-gemini-api-and-google-ai-studio/).

In practice, 1 million tokens would look like:

-   50,000 lines of code (with the standard 80 characters per line)
-   All the text messages you have sent in the last 5 years
-   8 average length English novels
-   Transcripts of over 200 average length podcast episodes

Even though the models can take in more and more context, much of the conventional wisdom about using large language models assumes this inherent limitation on the model, which as of 2024, is no longer the case.

Some common strategies to handle the limitation of small context windows included:

-   Arbitrarily dropping old messages / text from the context window as new text comes in
-   Summarizing previous content and replacing it with the summary when the context window gets close to being full
-   Using RAG with semantic search to move data out of the context window and into a vector database
-   Using deterministic or generative filters to remove certain text / characters from prompts to save tokens

While many of these are still relevant in certain cases, the default place to start is now just putting all of the tokens into the context window. Because Gemini models were purpose-built with a long context window, they are much more capable of in-context learning. For example, with only instructional materials (a 500-page reference grammar, a dictionary, and ≈ 400 extra parallel sentences) all provided in context, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 1.5 Flash are [capable of learning to translate](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/gemini/gemini_v1_5_report.pdf) from English to Kalamang— a Papuan language with fewer than 200 speakers and therefore almost no online presence—with quality similar to a person who learned from the same materials.

This example underscores how you can start to think about what is possible with long context and the in-context learning capabilities of Gemini models.

## Long context use cases

While the standard use case for most generative models is still text input, the Gemini 1.5 model family enables a new paradigm of multimodal use cases. These models can natively understand text, video, audio, and images. They are accompanied by the [Gemini API that takes in multimodal file types](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/prompting_with_media) for convenience.

### Long form text

Text has proved to be the layer of intelligence underpinning much of the momentum around LLMs. As mentioned earlier, much of the practical limitation of LLMs was because of not having a large enough context window to do certain tasks. This led to the rapid adoption of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and other techniques which dynamically provide the model with relevant contextual information. Now, with larger and larger context windows (currently up to 2 million on Gemini 1.5 Pro), there are new techniques becoming available which unlock new use cases.

Some emerging and standard use cases for text based long context include:

-   Summarizing large corpuses of text
    -   Previous summarization options with smaller context models would require a sliding window or another technique to keep state of previous sections as new tokens are passed to the model
-   Question and answering
    -   Historically this was only possible with RAG given the limited amount of context and models' factual recall being low
-   Agentic workflows
    -   Text is the underpinning of how agents keep state of what they have done and what they need to do; not having enough information about the world and the agent's goal is a limitation on the reliability of agents

[Many-shot in-context learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11018) is one of the most unique capabilities unlocked by long context models. Research has shown that taking the common "single shot" or "multi-shot" example paradigm, where the model is presented with one or a few examples of a task, and scaling that up to hundreds, thousands, or even hundreds of thousands of examples, can lead to novel model capabilities. This many-shot approach has also been shown to perform similarly to models which were fine-tuned for a specific task. For use cases where a Gemini model's performance is not yet sufficient for a production rollout, you can try the many-shot approach. As you might explore later in the long context optimization section, context caching makes this type of high input token workload much more economically feasible and even lower latency in some cases.

### Long form video

Video content's utility has long been constrained by the lack of accessibility of the medium itself. It was hard to skim the content, transcripts often failed to capture the nuance of a video, and most tools don't process image, text, and audio together. With Gemini 1.5, the long-context text capabilities translate to the ability to reason and answer questions about multimodal inputs with sustained performance. Gemini 1.5 Flash, when tested on the needle in a video haystack problem with 1M tokens, obtained >99.8% recall of the video in the context window, and 1.5 Pro reached state of the art performance on the [Video-MME benchmark](https://video-mme.github.io/home_page.html).

Some emerging and standard use cases for video long context include:

-   Video question and answering
-   Video memory, as shown with [Google's Project Astra](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/project-astra/)
-   Video captioning
-   Video recommendation systems, by enriching existing metadata with new multimodal understanding
-   Video customization, by looking at a corpus of data and associated video metadata and then removing parts of videos that are not relevant to the viewer
-   Video content moderation
-   Real-time video processing

When working with videos, it is important to consider how the [videos are processed into tokens](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/tokens#media-token), which affects billing and usage limits. You can learn more about prompting with video files in the [Prompting guide](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/prompting_with_media?lang=python#prompting-with-videos).

### Long form audio

The Gemini 1.5 models were the first natively multimodal large language models that could understand audio. Historically, the typical developer workflow would involve stringing together multiple domain specific models, like a speech-to-text model and a text-to-text model, in order to process audio. This led to additional latency required by performing multiple round-trip requests and decreased performance usually attributed to disconnected architectures of the multiple model setup.

On standard audio-haystack evaluations, Gemini 1.5 Pro is able to find the hidden audio in 100% of the tests and Gemini 1.5 Flash is able to find it in 98.7% [of the tests](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/gemini/gemini_v1_5_report.pdf). Gemini 1.5 Flash accepts up to 9.5 hours of [audio in a single request](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/prompting_with_media?lang=python#audio_formats) and Gemini 1.5 Pro can accept up to 19 hours of audio using the 2-million-token context window. Further, on a test set of 15-minute audio clips, Gemini 1.5 Pro archives a word error rate (WER) of ~5.5%, much lower than even specialized speech-to-text models, without the added complexity of extra input segmentation and pre-processing.

Some emerging and standard use cases for audio context include:

-   Real-time transcription and translation
-   Podcast / video question and answering
-   Meeting transcription and summarization
-   Voice assistants

You can learn more about prompting with audio files in the [Prompting guide](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/prompting_with_media?lang=python#prompting-with-videos).

## Long context optimizations

The primary optimization when working with long context and the Gemini 1.5 models is to use [context caching](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/caching). Beyond the previous impossibility of processing lots of tokens in a single request, the other main constraint was the cost. If you have a "chat with your data" app where a user uploads 10 PDFs, a video, and some work documents, you would historically have to work with a more complex retrieval augmented generation (RAG) tool / framework in order to process these requests and pay a significant amount for tokens moved into the context window. Now, you can cache the files the user uploads and pay to store them on a per hour basis. The input / output cost per request with Gemini 1.5 Flash for example is ~4x less than the standard input / output cost, so if the user chats with their data enough, it becomes a huge cost saving for you as the developer.

## Long context limitations

In various sections of this guide, we talked about how Gemini 1.5 models achieve high performance across various needle-in-a-haystack retrieval evals. These tests consider the most basic setup, where you have a single needle you are looking for. In cases where you might have multiple "needles" or specific pieces of information you are looking for, the model does not perform with the same accuracy. Performance can vary to a wide degree depending on the context. This is important to consider as there is an inherent tradeoff between getting the right information retrieved and cost. You can get ~99% on a single query, but you have to pay the input token cost every time you send that query. So for 100 pieces of information to be retrieved, if you needed 99% performance, you would likely need to send 100 requests. This is a good example of where context caching can significantly reduce the cost associated with using Gemini models while keeping the performance high.

## FAQs

### Where is the best place to put my query in the context window?

In most cases, especially if the total context is long, the model's performance will be better if you put your query / question at the end of the prompt (after all the other context).

### Do I lose model performance when I add more tokens to a query?

Generally, if you don't need tokens to be passed to the model, it is best to avoid passing them. However, if you have a large chunk of tokens with some information and want to ask questions about that information, the model is highly capable of extracting that information (up to 99% accuracy in many cases).

### How does Gemini 1.5 Pro perform on the standard needle-in-a-haystack test?

Gemini 1.5 Pro achieves 100% recall up to 530k tokens and >99.7% recall [up to 1M tokens](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/gemini/gemini_v1_5_report.pdf).

### How can I lower my cost with long-context queries?

If you have a similar set of tokens / context that you want to re-use many times, [context caching](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/caching) can help reduce the costs associated with asking questions about that information.

### How can I get access to the 2-million-token context window?

All developers now have access to the 2-million-token context window with Gemini 1.5 Pro.

### Does the context length affect the model latency?

There is some fixed amount of latency in any given request, regardless of the size, but generally longer queries will have higher latency (time to first token).

### Do the long context capabilities differ between Gemini 1.5 Flash and Gemini 1.5 Pro?

Yes, some of the numbers were mentioned in different sections of this guide, but generally Gemini 1.5 Pro is more performant on most long context use cases.
